Imaginarium is an AI tool that generates random fictitious entities (items, characters, monsters, etc.) for use in tabletop role playing.
It lets you define programs called generators that make random instances of different kinds of objects.

For example, the following lets you generate random groups of cats, along with their relationships:

  A cat is a kind of person.
  Persian, tabby, Siamese, manx, Chartreux, and Maine coon are kinds of cat.
  Cats are long-haired or short-haired.
  Cats can be big or small.
  Cats can be cuddly or haughty.
  A cat can be staid or crazy.
  The plural of Chartreux is Chartreux.
  The plural of Siamese is Siamese.
  Chartreux are grey.
  Siamese are grey.
  Persians are long-haired.
  Siamese are short-haired.
  Maine coons are large.
  Cats are black, white, grey, or ginger.

  Cats can love other cats
  Cats can hate other cats
  Love and hate are mutually exclusive.
